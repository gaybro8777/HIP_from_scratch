This repository contains several tutorials that teach the basic concepts of HIP. These
tutorials should not require prior knowledge of GPU or CUDA programming, although general
programming knowledge in C or C++ is necessary.

This a work in progress.

Go in order from 0_intro onwards as they introduce the HIP concepts slowly.
