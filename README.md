This repository contains several tutorials that teach the basic concepts of HIP. These
tutorials should not require prior knowledge of GPU or CUDA programming, although general
programming knowledge is necessary.

This a work in progress.



TODO:

- write a monte carlo pi calculation tutorial (HIP+MPI?)
- tutorial on shared memory and memory coalescing
- tutorial on streams
