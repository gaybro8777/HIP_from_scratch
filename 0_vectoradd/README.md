# Basics of HIP

This tutorial will walk you through the basic components of HIP through writing a simple
Vector Add program in C++. This tutorial requires familiarity with C or C++ and does not
require familiarity with CUDA. This tutorial will use Summit for compiling and running
with its cuda-hip module. The full example code can be found in the file
VectorAdd.cpp in this repository.
